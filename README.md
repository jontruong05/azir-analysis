# The Effectiveness of Azir in Pro Play (2024)

The Effectiveness of Azir in Pro Play (2024) is a comprehensive data science project conducted at UCSD. It begins with exploratory data analysis and segues into hypothesis testing, the creation of a predictive model, and a fairness analysis. This project uses performance stats to reason whether Azir, one of many playable champions in the game League of Legends, is an effective pick or not in the 2024 competitive scene.

## Introduction

League of Legends (LoL) is a popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) developed by Riot Games. With a playerbase of millions of people, it is the most popular esport in the world. The dataset that this project uses is maintained by Oracleâ€™s Elixir. It contains a wealth of information from all professional LoL esports games in 2024. 

Azir is a unique, yet difficult champion known for his high damage and team fighting potential. Commonly played in the mid lane, he can summon sand soldiers and command them to attack and relocate. He can also push a large number of enemies into a direction he desires, which can turn the tides of a fight. 

Because of his unique set of abilities and the influence he can have on games, the overall question I would like to investigate is: **Is Azir a **

### NMAR Analysis

In the dataset, it is believed that the columns `pick1`, `pick2`, `pick3`, `pick4`, and `pick5` are all data that are Not Missing at Random (NMAR). For any game, each team must pick five champions, and they do not have to be in positional order (top, jungle, mid, bottom, support). It would be reasonable to think that no games should have any missing data on the pick order of champions. Given this, it does not seem like these columns follow any trend of missingness. There is also no evidence that the missingness of the data in these columns rely on the data from other columns. 

An additional column that we could add to make these columns' data Missing At Random (MAR) is `pick_order`, which contains integers from 1 to 5 (inclusive), that represent the order that the champion was picked.
